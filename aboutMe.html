                    <h3>Shoes/Keyboards</h3>
                    <p>
                        <!-- While I woulnd't consider myself to be a hardcore sneakerhead, I do have a somewhat decent shoe collection, perhaps more than the average Joe. I got into shoes maybe around grade 11. 
                        I remember starving myself during lunch because I would rather save up the lunch money and buy shoes instead (parents eventually found out and they were not happy). I don't regret a single thing.
                        Most of my casual kicks are Adidas. I'm talking NMDs, UBs, EQTs, Pureboosts, Alphabounces, I've pretty much tried the lot. Eyeing myself a pair of Continental 80s currently.
                        I'm also really into basketball shoes especially, from the design to the performance ratings to all the groundbreaking tech inside them. 
                        Currently, my rotation consists of KD6s, Melo M9, Melo M12, PG4s, Zoom Freak 2s, and Kyrie 4s.   -->

                        Recently, I got into the great big world of keyboards, and I must admit it is definitely an interest that's unique with a phenomoenal international community behind it. 
                        As someone who uses the computer very often, I think it's important to get a piece of equipment that is perfectly suited towards your specific taste/preference.
                        Every keyboard has a distinct set of features along with a unique typing experience, so I'm always on the lookout for new intruiging releases. 
                        I love the fact that mechanical keyboards in particular are so highly customizable, and some really unqiue and interesting designs have come out of it. 
                        I haven't tried building my own yet, but I would love one day. Right now I'm hoping to acquire a board that is hot-swappable so I can try out all the exotic switch types that are out there.
                        Right now, my mechanical collection consists of a Fnatic miniStreak (Cherry mx silent reds), an XG KB-2128 (outemu blues).

                    <h3>Device Modding/Repair</h3>
                    <p>
                       Although somewhat of a weird niche, I enjoy fixing/tinkering with all sorts of electronic devices, most notably PS4 controllers. I have replaced the cracked screen of a 2012 Google Nexus 7 
                       as well as numerous PS4 controller fixes/customizations. The first memory I have of fixing controllers was in grade 10,
                       when I replaced the loose micro USB charging port on the controller. I then went in again and replaced the faulty springs on the triggers. After a while I replaced the analog sticks and buttons with some metal golden pieces.
                       At the time of writing, I am waiting for the shipment of a membrane circuit film, as I plan on fixing a broken controller that I bought second hand. In my opinion, the customization/fixing of controllers is just as much fun as playing the games themselves.

                    <h3>NBA</h3>
                    <p>
                        Huge fan of basketball here. I realized that ever since the pandemic, I have been playing basketball more frequently. Outdoor hoops are commonplace, doesn't require alot of equipment, and you have the option to play alone ðŸ˜¢. 
                        If I'm not playing basketball, then you can probably find me watching basketball, more specifically, the NBA. Not only is the sport itself pretty fast-paced and entertaining, but I also love the narratives that come with it.
                        The intense rivalries are what makes the NBA entertaining for me. I enjoy watching the top teams compete against each other, superstars against another.  
                        Speaking of player, some of my favourites include KD, Melo (if you're not sure which one, you're way too young), Brandon Ingram, TMac, PG13, and Trae Young.

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hopefully to no one's surprise, I love listening to music. Been doing so ever since I was little. I wouldn't consider myself to have unique taste, because quite honestly the stuff I listen to is quite mainstream. 
                        However, I still like to arrogantly think that my playlist is objectively better than everyone else's. It'll take forever to list out my favourite artists, so I'll just name a few:
                        MGK, G-Eazy, Roddy Ricch, Kid Ink, Lil Tjay, Tee Grizzley, Kid Laroi, Juice Wrld, Lil Skies, 88Glam, and Manila Grey. (Whew!)
